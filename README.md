An important part of cybersecurity is controlling access to restricted content. In this project, I worked with a 
text file containing IP addresses that are allowed to access specific restricted content at an organization. 
Firstly, inorder to access the text file, I have to use Parsing which allows security analysts to read and update content. 
I used Python scripting because it helps analysts develop algorithms to automate the process of parsing files and keeping 
them up-to-date. So therefore, the algorithm parses the text file of IP addresses and updates the file by removing IP addresses 
that no longer have access to restricted content at an organisation.
